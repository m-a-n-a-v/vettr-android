# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-07
Project: VETTR Android
---

## Codebase Patterns
- All ViewModels use @HiltViewModel with @Inject constructor and StateFlow for UI state
- Compose screens use collectAsStateWithLifecycle() for state collection
- Room entities use @Entity annotation with @PrimaryKey
- Hilt modules use @Module + @InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
- Design tokens in designsystem/theme/ - NEVER hardcode colors or fonts
- Navigation uses Navigation Compose with sealed class routes
- JAVA_HOME must point to Android Studio JBR: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home
- Build command: JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew assembleDebug
---

## US-001: Verify minSdk 26 and compileSdk 35 configuration
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Updated app/build.gradle.kts: compileSdk 36 → 35, targetSdk 36 → 35
- Verified minSdk = 26 (already correct)
- Verified Java 17 compatibility (already correct)
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - JAVA_HOME must be set to Android Studio JBR for builds
  - Use sed for PRD updates: `sed -i '' 's/"passes": false/"passes": true/' prd.json` within story context
  - Build warnings about deprecated statusBarColor/navigationBarColor are expected (deprecated in API)
---
## US-002: Create package folder structure
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Created core packages: core/, core/model/, core/data/, core/data/local/, core/data/remote/, core/data/repository/, core/di/, core/util/
- Created designsystem packages: designsystem/component/, designsystem/icon/
- Created feature packages: feature/auth/, feature/pulse/, feature/discovery/, feature/stockdetail/, feature/alerts/, feature/profile/, feature/main/
- Added .gitkeep files to all 18 new directories for Git tracking
- Verified build: ./gradlew assembleDebug succeeds
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `find ... -type d -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;` to add .gitkeep files to multiple directories efficiently
  - Package structure follows clean architecture: core (data/business logic), designsystem (UI components), feature (screens)
  - .gitkeep files are necessary to track empty directories in Git

## US-003: Verify Hilt dependency injection setup
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Verified @HiltAndroidApp annotation on VettrApp (VettrApp.kt:6)
- Verified @AndroidEntryPoint annotation on MainActivity (MainActivity.kt:19)
- Verified hilt-android and hilt-android-compiler dependencies (build.gradle.kts:84-85)
- Verified ksp plugin applied (build.gradle.kts:6)
- Verified VettrApp registered in AndroidManifest.xml (android:name=".VettrApp")
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hilt was already properly configured in the initial scaffold
  - Key Hilt setup components: @HiltAndroidApp on Application, @AndroidEntryPoint on Activity, ksp plugin for annotation processing
  - Hilt version 2.53.1 with androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose 1.2.0 for Compose integration
  - ksp tasks (kspDebugKotlin, hiltAggregateDepsDebug, hiltJavaCompileDebug) run automatically during build
---
## US-004: Verify Room database dependencies
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Verified room-runtime, room-ktx, and room-compiler (ksp) dependencies in build.gradle.kts (lines 76-78)
- Verified KSP plugin applied in build.gradle.kts (line 6)
- Created VettrDatabase abstract class in core/data/local/VettrDatabase.kt
- Created PlaceholderEntity in core/model/PlaceholderEntity.kt (Room requires at least one entity in @Database annotation)
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Room @Database annotation requires at least one entity in entities array - empty array causes KSP compilation error
  - Created placeholder entity PlaceholderEntity to satisfy Room requirement until real entities are added
  - Room dependencies were already properly configured in initial scaffold (room-runtime, room-ktx, room-compiler with ksp)
  - VettrDatabase will be used as the single source of truth for local data persistence

- Verified kotlinx-coroutines-android and kotlinx-coroutines-core dependencies (version 1.9.0) in app/build.gradle.kts:99-100
- All dependencies properly defined in gradle/libs.versions.toml version catalog
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Networking dependencies were already properly configured in the initial scaffold

- Verified Coil version 3.0.4 in gradle/libs.versions.toml
- Created CoilVerification.kt in core/util/ with AsyncImage composable to verify import compiles
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Coil 3.x uses coil3.compose.AsyncImage (not coil.compose.AsyncImage from v2)
  - Coil dependencies were already properly configured in the initial scaffold
  - Coil 3.0.4 with coil-network-okhttp provides efficient image loading with OkHttp backend
  - AsyncImage is the primary composable for loading images in Jetpack Compose

---
## US-011: Create .gitignore for Android project
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Verified .gitignore already contains all required entries from acceptance criteria
- .gitignore includes: .gradle/, build/, .idea/, *.iml, local.properties, .DS_Store, captures/, .externalNativeBuild/, .cxx/
- Verified git status --ignored shows no tracked files in ignore list (all properly excluded)
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
Files changed:
- .gitignore was already properly configured in the initial project scaffold
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The initial project scaffold included a comprehensive .gitignore file
  - git status --ignored command is useful to verify ignored files aren't being tracked
  - Android projects typically ignore: build artifacts (.gradle/, build/, *.iml), IDE files (.idea/), local config (local.properties), OS files (.DS_Store), native build outputs (.externalNativeBuild/, .cxx/), and profiling data (*.hprof)
