# Ralph Progress Log

Project: VETTR Android

## Codebase Patterns
- All ViewModels use @HiltViewModel with @Inject constructor and StateFlow for UI state
- Compose screens use collectAsStateWithLifecycle() for state collection
- Room entities use @Entity annotation with @PrimaryKey
- Hilt modules use @Module + @InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
- Design tokens in designsystem/theme/ - NEVER hardcode colors or fonts
- Navigation uses Navigation Compose with sealed class routes
- JAVA_HOME must point to Android Studio JBR: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home
- Build command: JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home" ./gradlew assembleDebug

## US-001: Verify minSdk 26 and compileSdk 35 configuration
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Updated app/build.gradle.kts: compileSdk 36 → 35, targetSdk 36 → 35
- Verified minSdk = 26 (already correct)
- Verified Java 17 compatibility (already correct)
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - JAVA_HOME must be set to Android Studio JBR for builds
  - Use sed for PRD updates: `sed -i '' 's/"passes": false/"passes": true/' prd.json` within story context
  - Build warnings about deprecated statusBarColor/navigationBarColor are expected (deprecated in API)

## US-002: Create package folder structure
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Created core packages: core/, core/model/, core/data/, core/data/local/, core/data/remote/, core/data/repository/, core/di/, core/util/
- Created designsystem packages: designsystem/component/, designsystem/icon/
- Created feature packages: feature/auth/, feature/pulse/, feature/discovery/, feature/stockdetail/, feature/alerts/, feature/profile/, feature/main/
- Added .gitkeep files to all 18 new directories for Git tracking
- Verified build: ./gradlew assembleDebug succeeds
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `find ... -type d -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;` to add .gitkeep files to multiple directories efficiently
  - Package structure follows clean architecture: core (data/business logic), designsystem (UI components), feature (screens)
  - .gitkeep files are necessary to track empty directories in Git

## US-003: Verify Hilt dependency injection setup
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-07
Details:
- Verified @HiltAndroidApp annotation on VettrApp (VettrApp.kt:6)
- Verified @AndroidEntryPoint annotation on MainActivity (MainActivity.kt:19)
- Verified hilt-android and hilt-android-compiler dependencies (build.gradle.kts:84-85)
- Verified ksp plugin applied (build.gradle.kts:6)
- Verified VettrApp registered in AndroidManifest.xml (android:name=".VettrApp")
- Build successful: ./gradlew assembleDebug passes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hilt was already properly configured in the initial scaffold
  - Key Hilt setup components: @HiltAndroidApp on Application, @AndroidEntryPoint on Activity, ksp plugin for annotation processing
  - Hilt version 2.53.1 with androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose 1.2.0 for Compose integration
  - ksp tasks (kspDebugKotlin, hiltAggregateDepsDebug, hiltJavaCompileDebug) run automatically during build
