Excellent! US-001 is complete. The story has been implemented, all acceptance criteria met, changes committed, PRD updated, and progress logged.

## Summary

**US-001: Verify minSdk 26 and compileSdk 35 configuration** - ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done:
1. Updated `app/build.gradle.kts` to set `compileSdk = 35` and `targetSdk = 35` (was 36)
2. Verified `minSdk = 26` and Java 17 compatibility were already correct
3. Build successful: `./gradlew assembleDebug` passes without errors
4. Committed changes with message: `feat: US-001 - Verify minSdk 26 and compileSdk 35 configuration`
5. Updated PRD to mark `passes: true` for US-001
6. Appended progress report to `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`

### Files changed:
- `/Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Updated compileSdk and targetSdk from 36 to 35

The next iteration will pick up US-002 (Create package folder structure).
Iteration 1 complete. Continuing...

Excellent! US-002 has been successfully completed. Let me provide a summary.

## US-002: Create package folder structure - COMPLETE ✅

I've successfully implemented the package folder structure for the VETTR Android app:

**Created packages:**
- **core/**: model, data (local, remote, repository), di, util
- **designsystem/**: component, icon  
- **feature/**: auth, pulse, discovery, stockdetail, alerts, profile, main

**Verification:**
- Added .gitkeep files to all 18 new directories for Git tracking
- Build passed: `./gradlew assembleDebug` succeeded
- Changes committed with message: `feat: US-002 - Create package folder structure`
- PRD updated: US-002 marked as `passes: true`
- Progress log updated with learnings

The package structure now follows clean architecture principles with clear separation between core business logic, design system components, and feature modules.
Iteration 2 complete. Continuing...

Perfect! US-003 has been completed successfully. Let me verify the completion:

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-003: Verify Hilt dependency injection setup**. 

### Verification Results:
✅ **@HiltAndroidApp** annotation present on VettrApp (VettrApp.kt:6)  
✅ **@AndroidEntryPoint** annotation present on MainActivity (MainActivity.kt:19)  
✅ **hilt-android** and **hilt-android-compiler** dependencies configured (build.gradle.kts:84-85)  
✅ **ksp plugin** applied for annotation processing (build.gradle.kts:6)  
✅ **VettrApp** registered in AndroidManifest.xml  
✅ **./gradlew assembleDebug** builds successfully

### What I Did:
- Verified all Hilt configuration was already properly set up in the initial project scaffold
- Confirmed the build passes with Hilt annotation processing working correctly
- Updated prd.json to mark US-003 as complete (`passes: true`)
- Appended detailed progress to progress.txt
- Committed the changes with message: `feat: US-003 - Verify Hilt dependency injection setup`

The Hilt dependency injection framework is fully configured and ready for use throughout the VETTR Android app.
Iteration 3 complete. Continuing...

  Ralph Iteration 4 of 158 (claude)
===============================================================
Perfect! **US-004: Verify Room database dependencies** has been completed successfully.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented US-004 with the following changes:

### What was done:
1. **Verified Room dependencies** - Confirmed room-runtime, room-ktx, and room-compiler (ksp) are properly configured in build.gradle.kts:76-78
2. **Verified KSP plugin** - Confirmed KSP plugin is applied in build.gradle.kts:6
3. **Created VettrDatabase** - Created placeholder database class in `app/src/main/java/com/vettr/android/core/data/local/VettrDatabase.kt`
4. **Created PlaceholderEntity** - Room requires at least one entity in the @Database annotation, so I created a minimal placeholder entity in `app/src/main/java/com/vettr/android/core/model/PlaceholderEntity.kt`
5. **Build verified** - ./gradlew assembleDebug passes successfully
6. **Committed changes** - All changes committed with message: `feat: US-004 - Verify Room database dependencies`
7. **Updated PRD** - Marked US-004 as `passes: true`
8. **Logged progress** - Appended details to scripts/ralph/progress.txt

### Key Learning:
Room's @Database annotation requires at least one entity in the entities array. An empty array causes a KSP compilation error: "@Database annotation must specify list of entities". The PlaceholderEntity will be removed once real entities are added in future stories.
Iteration 4 complete. Continuing...

  Ralph Iteration 5 of 158 (claude)
===============================================================
Excellent! US-005 has been completed successfully. Here's what was accomplished:

## US-005: Verify Retrofit and OkHttp networking dependencies ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE

**What was verified:**
- ✅ Retrofit 2.11.0 (retrofit + retrofit-converter-gson) - app/build.gradle.kts:89-90
- ✅ OkHttp 4.12.0 (okhttp + okhttp-logging-interceptor) - app/build.gradle.kts:91-92
- ✅ Coroutines 1.9.0 (kotlinx-coroutines-android + kotlinx-coroutines-core) - app/build.gradle.kts:99-100
- ✅ All dependencies properly configured in gradle/libs.versions.toml version catalog
- ✅ Build passes: `./gradlew assembleDebug` succeeded

**Key findings:**
- All networking dependencies were already properly configured in the initial project scaffold
- The version catalog pattern centralizes dependency version management across the project
- Retrofit provides type-safe HTTP client with Gson for JSON serialization
- OkHttp includes logging interceptor for debugging network calls
- Coroutines enable suspend functions for asynchronous operations

The changes have been committed and the PRD has been updated to mark US-005 as passing.
Iteration 5 complete. Continuing...
