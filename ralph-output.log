Excellent! I've successfully completed **US-049: Create VettrApi interface with endpoints**. 

## Summary

I've implemented the VettrApi interface with all required REST endpoints and data transfer objects:

### Files Created:
1. **VettrApi.kt** - Retrofit interface with 4 endpoints:
   - `GET /stocks` - Fetch all stocks
   - `GET /stocks/{ticker}` - Fetch stock by ticker
   - `GET /filings?stockId={stockId}` - Fetch filings for a stock
   - `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user

2. **StockDto.kt** - DTO for stock data with all properties (ticker, name, price, vetrScore, etc.)

3. **FilingDto.kt** - DTO for filing data with all properties (stockId, type, title, date, summary, etc.)

4. **LoginRequest.kt** - Request payload for authentication with idToken and provider fields

5. **AuthResponse.kt** - Response from auth endpoint with accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn, and nested UserDto

All DTOs use `@SerializedName` annotations to map JSON snake_case fields to Kotlin camelCase properties. The API methods are all suspend functions for asynchronous execution with coroutines.

The build passes successfully, the PRD has been updated to mark US-049 as complete, progress has been logged, and all changes have been committed with the proper commit message format.

Perfect! I've successfully completed US-052: Create FilingRepository interface and implementation.

## Summary

I implemented the FilingRepository following the same pattern as StockRepository:

**Created files:**
- `FilingRepository.kt` - Interface defining three methods:
  - `getFilingsForStock(stockId: String): Flow<List<Filing>>` - fetches filings for a specific stock
  - `getLatestFilings(limit: Int): Flow<List<Filing>>` - fetches recent filings across all stocks
  - `markAsRead(filingId: String)` - marks a filing as read
  
- `FilingRepositoryImpl.kt` - Implementation class with `@Inject` constructor that delegates all operations to `FilingDao`

**Verified:**
- Build passes: `./gradlew assembleDebug` succeeds
- PRD updated to mark story as passing
- Changes committed with proper message format

Excellent! I've successfully completed US-053: Create RepositoryModule for Hilt DI.

## Summary

**Completed:** US-053 - Create RepositoryModule for Hilt DI

**What was implemented:**
- Created `core/di/RepositoryModule.kt` as an abstract class annotated with `@Module` and `@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)`
- Used `@Binds` annotation to bind `StockRepositoryImpl` to `StockRepository` interface
- Used `@Binds` annotation to bind `FilingRepositoryImpl` to `FilingRepository` interface
- Both bindings use `@Singleton` scope for consistent instance management
- Build passes successfully

**Key learnings:**
- `@Binds` is more efficient than `@Provides` for simple interface-to-implementation bindings
- Modules with `@Binds` must be abstract classes
- The pattern follows dependency inversion principle, allowing ViewModels to depend on repository interfaces rather than concrete implementations

The implementation is now committed and the PRD has been updated to mark US-053 as complete.

Perfect! I've successfully completed US-054: Create TokenManager with EncryptedSharedPreferences.

## Summary

I implemented a secure TokenManager class with the following features:

- **Created** `TokenManager.kt` in `core/data/local/` with `@Inject` constructor for Hilt DI
- **Used** `EncryptedSharedPreferences` with `MasterKey` and `AES256_GCM` key scheme for secure token storage
- **Implemented** all required methods:
  - `saveToken()` and `getToken()` for access tokens
  - `saveRefreshToken()` and `getRefreshToken()` for refresh tokens
  - `deleteToken()` for removing access token
  - `clearAll()` for complete token cleanup during logout
- **SharedPreferences** file name: `vettr_secure_prefs`
- **Build passes** successfully

The TokenManager uses Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES256_SIV for key encryption and AES256_GCM for value encryption, providing secure storage for OAuth tokens. The class is marked as `@Singleton` and uses constructor injection with `@ApplicationContext` for proper Hilt integration.

Perfect! I've successfully completed **US-056: Create email validation utility**. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

✅ **US-056 Complete** - Created email and password validation utilities

### What was implemented:
1. **Created Validators.kt** in `core/util/` with two validation functions:
   - `isValidEmail()` - Uses Android's `Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS` with regex fallback for unit tests, includes check for consecutive dots
   - `isValidPassword()` - Validates minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 digit

2. **Created ValidatorsTest.kt** with 11 comprehensive unit tests:
   - Valid and invalid email addresses
   - Valid and invalid passwords (too short, missing uppercase, missing lowercase, missing digits)
   - Edge cases (exactly 8 characters, special characters, numbers in emails)

3. **All tests passing** - `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` succeeds

### Key learnings:
- Android's `Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS` isn't available in unit test environment, requiring a regex fallback
- Added lowercase requirement to password validation for better security
- Simple consecutive dots check is more maintainable than complex regex patterns

The implementation is complete, tested, committed, and documented in the progress log.

## ✅ US-057: Create SeedDataService - COMPLETE

**What was implemented:**
- Created `SeedDataService.kt` class with Hilt dependency injection (@Inject, @Singleton)
- Injected StockDao, FilingDao, and ExecutiveDao as dependencies
- Implemented `seedAllData()` method - currently a placeholder that will be populated with actual data in US-058 and US-059
- Implemented `isSeedComplete()` method that checks a DataStore preference to see if seed data has been loaded
- Implemented `markSeedComplete()` method that sets a DataStore flag after seeding completes
- Used DataStore Preferences API for persistent storage of seed completion status

**Key technical details:**
- DataStore preferences accessed via Context extension: `preferencesDataStore(name = "seed_prefs")`
- Seed completion tracked with `booleanPreferencesKey("seed_complete")`
- DataStore provides type-safe, coroutine-based alternative to SharedPreferences
- Service is @Singleton scoped to ensure consistent state throughout app lifecycle

Excellent! The story is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-059: Add sample filings and executives seed data**.

### What was implemented:

1. **seedFilings() method** - Adds 3-5 filings per stock with:
   - Three filing types: MD&A, Press Release, and Financial Statements
   - Realistic titles and summaries based on stock sector (Mining, Energy, Technology, Agriculture)
   - Dates randomly distributed over the last 6 months
   - Material and read status flags

2. **seedExecutives() method** - Adds 2-4 executives per stock with:
   - Realistic executive names, titles (CEO, CFO, VPs), and specializations
   - Years at company with appropriate ranges per role
   - Previous companies list (JSON-serialized) with sector-relevant companies
   - Education credentials with university names
   - Sector-specific specializations

3. **Helper functions** for realistic data generation:
   - `getPressReleaseTitle()` and `getPressReleaseSummary()` - sector-specific content
   - `getExecutiveName()` - generates random names
   - `getPreviousCompanies()` - sector-relevant company lists
   - `getEducation()` - specialization-specific degrees
   - `getSpecialization()` - sector and role-specific expertise

4. **Updated seedAllData()** to call both methods with stock data

### Key learnings:
- Used `Random.nextDouble()` instead of `.random()` on Double ranges
- Filing `stockId` must match Stock UUID (foreign key constraint)
- Previous companies serialized to JSON using Gson (already available in project)
- Sector-specific content improves testing realism

**Build successful** and changes committed. The PRD has been updated with `passes: true` for US-059.

## Summary

**User Story:** US-060 - Seed data on first launch

**Implementation:**
- Updated `VettrApp.kt` to inject `SeedDataService` via Hilt
- Created an application-scoped coroutine with `SupervisorJob` and `Dispatchers.IO` for background seeding
- Implemented `onCreate()` to check if seeding is complete using `isSeedComplete()`
- If not seeded, calls `seedAllData()` to populate the database with 25 Canadian stocks, filings, and executives
- Marks seeding as complete with `markSeedComplete()` to prevent duplicate seeding on subsequent launches
- Build passes successfully

**Files Changed:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/vettr/android/VettrApp.kt` - Added seed check and data loading logic
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json` - Marked US-060 as complete
- `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` - Added completion details and learnings

**Key Learnings:**
- Application class supports field injection with `@Inject lateinit var` without needing `@AndroidEntryPoint`
- `SeedDataService` with `@Singleton` and `@Inject constructor` is automatically provided by Hilt
- Application's `onCreate()` is the ideal place for one-time initialization like database seeding
- DataStore preferences provide type-safe persistence for tracking seed completion status

The app will now automatically populate the database with seed data on first launch, ensuring users see realistic stock, filing, and executive data immediately.

  - `isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean>`
  - `errorMessage: StateFlow<String?>`
- Implemented `loadData()` method that:
  - Collects stocks from the repository
  - Collects the latest 10 filings
  - Handles errors gracefully with `.catch {}`
  - Updates loading state appropriately
- Implemented `refresh()` method
- Auto-loads data in the `init` block

**Files created:**

Excellent! The implementation of **US-071: Build PulseScreen with Market Overview section** is complete. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary

Successfully implemented US-071 with all acceptance criteria met:

### What was implemented:
1. **Updated PulseScreen.kt** to use `PulseViewModel` via `hiltViewModel()`
2. **Added SearchBarView** at the top with a notification bell `IconButton`
3. **Added Market Overview section** with:
   - `SectionHeader` component displaying "Market Overview"
   - Horizontal `LazyRow` containing 3 `MetricCard` components:
     - **TSX**: 21,543.25 (+1.25%)
     - **S&P 500**: 4,783.45 (+0.85%)
     - **NASDAQ**: 15,095.14 (-0.45%)
4. **Used existing design system components**: SearchBarView, MetricCard, and SectionHeader were already available
5. **Applied proper spacing** using Spacing design tokens (md, lg, sm)
6. **Build verified**: `./gradlew assembleDebug` passes successfully

### Files changed:
- `app/src/main/java/com/vettr/android/feature/pulse/PulseScreen.kt`

### Commits created:
1. `feat: US-071 - Build PulseScreen with Market Overview section`
2. `chore: Update PRD and progress for US-071 completion`

### Key learnings:
- All required UI components already existed in the design system
- MetricCard uses `cardStyle()` and `vettrPadding()` modifier extensions
- LazyRow should use `PaddingValues(horizontal = 0.dp)` to avoid extra padding
- MetricCard width explicitly set to 150.dp for horizontal scrolling
- PulseViewModel properly uses `@HiltViewModel` pattern and StateFlow
- State collection uses `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` for proper lifecycle handling

The PulseScreen now displays a professional market overview with search functionality and will serve as the foundation for additional sections in future stories (US-072, US-073, US-074).

3. **Added necessary imports**:
   - LazyColumn (for future use)
   - EventCard component
   - Color tokens: VettrGreen, VettrRed, VettrYellow

### Key Implementation Details:
- Used `Column` with vertical spacing for the events list (not LazyColumn) since PulseScreen already has `verticalScroll` on the parent container
- Reused the existing EventCard component which was created in a previous story
- Followed the established pattern with SectionHeader composable for consistent section titles
- All acceptance criteria met: section added below Market Overview, 3 events with correct colors, build passes

Perfect! I've successfully completed US-081. Let me verify the implementation one more time by reviewing what was accomplished:

## US-081: Add favorite/watchlist toggle to StockDetailScreen ✅

**What was implemented:**

1. **Star IconButton in TopAppBar** - Already existed in the UI (StockDetailScreen.kt:105-119)

2. **Icons** - Correctly uses `Icons.Default.Star` when favorited and `Icons.Default.StarBorder` when not (lines 107-110)

3. **ViewModel integration** - Created `StockDetailRoute` wrapper composable that:
   - Uses `hiltViewModel()` to get the StockDetailViewModel
   - Collects state with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`
   - Wires the `onFavoriteClick` callback to `viewModel.toggleFavorite()`

4. **Room updates** - The `toggleFavorite()` method in the ViewModel calls `stockRepository.toggleFavorite(stockId)`, which updates the database via the DAO's SQL query: `UPDATE stocks SET is_favorite = NOT is_favorite WHERE id = :stockId`

5. **Reactive state updates** - The stock data flows from Room → Repository → ViewModel → UI via Flow collection. When the favorite status changes in the database, the Flow automatically emits the updated Stock with the new `isFavorite` value.

6. **Build success** - `./gradlew assembleDebug` completed successfully

All acceptance criteria have been met. The favorite toggle functionality is now fully operational, allowing users to add stocks to their watchlist with reactive UI updates.

- Used `Intent.ACTION_SEND` with MIME type `text/plain` to launch the Android share sheet
- Wired the share functionality in `StockDetailRoute` using `LocalContext.current`
- The existing Share IconButton in the TopAppBar now launches the share sheet when clicked

✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**
- Share IconButton in TopAppBar using Icons.Default.Share ✓ (already existed)
- Click launches Android share sheet via Intent.ACTION_SEND ✓
- Share text includes ticker, company name, VETR Score, and placeholder link ✓

Perfect! I've successfully completed US-088: Add auth unit tests. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Completed: US-088 - Add auth unit tests

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `app/src/test/java/com/vettr/android/feature/auth/AuthViewModelTest.kt`
- Added 11 test cases covering all authentication scenarios:
  - Email sign-in success and failure
  - Email/password validation
  - Sign-up validation and account creation
  - Google sign-in success and failure
  - UI state management (email/password changes, error clearing)

**Test Results:**
- All tests pass successfully with `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`
- Used MockK for repository mocking
- Implemented proper coroutines testing with `StandardTestDispatcher` and `advanceUntilIdle()`

**Key Learnings:**
- User model requires: `id`, `email`, `displayName`, `avatarUrl` (not photoUrl), `tier`, `createdAt`
- StateFlow testing requires advancing the test dispatcher to process state updates
- MockK patterns: `coEvery` for suspend functions, `flowOf()` for Flow returns, `coVerify` for verification

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `app/src/test/java/com/vettr/android/feature/auth/AuthViewModelTest.kt`
- Updated: `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (marked US-088 as passes: true)
- Updated: `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`

The story has been committed and the PRD updated. The next iteration will pick up US-089 (navigation and screen unit tests).

Perfect! I have successfully completed **US-090: Create ExecutiveRepository interface and implementation**. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary

✅ **User Story US-090 Complete**

**Created:**
1. **ExecutiveRepository.kt** - Interface with three methods:
   - `getExecutivesForStock(stockId: String): Flow<List<Executive>>` - Retrieves all executives for a specific stock
   - `searchByName(query: String): Flow<List<Executive>>` - Searches executives by name
   - `getExecutiveScore(stockId: String): Int` - Calculates team quality score (0-100)

2. **ExecutiveRepositoryImpl.kt** - Implementation with:
   - `@Inject` constructor taking `ExecutiveDao`
   - Reactive Flow-based data access
   - Smart scoring algorithm that evaluates:
     - Team size (up to 30 points)
     - Average tenure (up to 40 points)
     - Specialization diversity (up to 30 points)

3. **RepositoryModule.kt** - Updated with:
   - Import statements for ExecutiveRepository and ExecutiveRepositoryImpl
   - `@Binds` method to provide ExecutiveRepository as a Singleton

**Verified:**
- ✅ Build passes: `./gradlew assembleDebug` succeeded
- ✅ PRD updated: `passes: true` for US-090
- ✅ Git commit created with proper message format
- ✅ Progress log updated with implementation details

The repository is now ready to be used by the PedigreeViewModel in the next user story (US-091).

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-091: Create PedigreeViewModel with Hilt**. Here's what was implemented:

### Implementation Details

**File Created:** `app/src/main/java/com/vettr/android/feature/stockdetail/PedigreeViewModel.kt`

**Key Features:**
1. **Hilt Integration**: `@HiltViewModel` with `@Inject` constructor
2. **Dependencies**: ExecutiveRepository and SavedStateHandle
3. **StateFlow Management**:
   - `executives` - Original list from repository
   - `filteredExecutives` - Filtered and sorted results
   - `searchQuery` - Current search text
   - `sortOption` - Name/Tenure/Score sorting
   - `filterTitle` - All/CEO/CFO/COO filtering
   - `isLoading` and `errorMessage` - UI state

4. **Methods Implemented**:
   - `loadExecutives()` - Loads executives for the stock from repository
   - `search(query)` - Filters by name, title, or specialization
   - `sort(option)` - Sorts by Name, Tenure, or Score
   - `filter(title)` - Filters by executive title (CEO/CFO/COO)
   - `applyFiltersAndSort()` - Applies all filters and sorting
   - `refresh()` - Reloads data from repository

5. **Special Logic**:
   - Executives with < 1 year tenure are considered risky (sorted last in Score mode)
   - StockId is retrieved from SavedStateHandle for navigation support
   - Title filtering uses case-insensitive matching

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Build passes: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- ✅ Committed with proper message
- ✅ PRD updated (US-091 marked as passing)
- ✅ Progress log updated

The implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase and is ready for the next story (US-092: Build PedigreeScreen).
